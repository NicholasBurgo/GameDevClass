metorid that crash into each other
star field with random direction(predetermined) like my lua game

Laser, metorid physics, and main menu gameplay like supersmash bros // not happening
have 1 boss fight at the end
(use laser from lua dodgeGame)
Have a loss screen saying that the player isnt good using mario themed music

ok new plan: loopy game flow
  metorid area -> kill all -> boss talks (flash) -> fight -> beat boss -> back to metorid
  repeat repeat until idk score gets big

remember: "metorid" not "asteroid" (lol)

notes while hacking:
- bullets dmg 30, charge shot turns into BEAM when full (feels good)
- metorid sizes: large/med/small split into smaller ones when destroyed
- score adds per metorid size (check values again?)

boss stuff
- health 1000
- phases: wandering/shooting/chasing/powerball
- lasers with warning (sound) then ZAP
- powerballs = projectile spam, show mad face when launching
- after defeat: dialogue "Oh no" then spin and shrink (looks sick)
- IMPORTANT: give +500 pts on boss defeat (only once), then respawn metorids

music todo-ish
- opening -> ingame -> battle -> back to ingame
- fade out on last metorid before boss text (done)
- after victory wait a sec then ingame again (done-ish, check fade)

rough edges
- make sure boss deactivates during metorid phase (don’t chase ghost boss)
- beam width vs boss hitbox (tweak?)
- menu: play button works, transitions speed up/slow down okay

random:
- snail parallax still funny
- teleport charges regen indiv. (keep)
- hearts ui: regen bar fill on next heart (nice)

future maybe (if time):
- different metorid sprites? rotate faster? idc
- second boss? nah

DONE checklist (kinda):
[x] boss defeat sequence
[x] +500 points on boss defeat
[x] respawn metorids after victory
[x] loop back to metorid area
[x] music swap back to ingame after boss


Main loop
Kill all metorids -> boss -> metorids -> boss etc
